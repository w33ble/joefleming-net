I recently got an email saying that I had a new user register here. Out of curiosity, I checked who it was, but neither the name nor the email was familiar to me. The username was alina77vere9uk and the email `alina77vere@gmail.com`, which to me looked like the kind of email address that you'd see on a SPAM email, so I tossed it into Google to see what I'd find.

Sure enough, I'm not the only person who's had this user register. As pointed out [over at the Cubelodyte's lair](http://cubelodyte.com/2008/03/21/another-slice-of-spam/), this is most likely a bot that is registering on Wordpess blogs all over the Internet, and while it's not posting any comments, it's highly likely that it'll release some kind of SPAM payload at a later date. So, if you see this user register on your Wordpress blog, go ahead and delete them before then SPAM hits the fan.

UPDATE: The user *joker* says the following:

    I really don't understand why people delete the account. I came up with what I think is a better solution than just deleting the account.

    - I changed the password for that account.
    - I made it so the user doesn't even have read rights. Thanks Role Manager.
    - I changed almost everything about the user to indicate it is a spam account.
    - I disabled the forgot password feature. Thanks WP-IDS.

That's actually a really good idea; keep the account active but disable it. That way the user can't be re-created. Crafty!
