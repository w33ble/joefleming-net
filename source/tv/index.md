<summary>What is this?</summary>
I was watching some reviews of The Acolyte and one video was claiming that it was so bad people weren't even bothering to pirate it. However, when I checked the tracker I use, it was quite popular. I obviously don't know *why* it's so popular, but the reviews I've seen for it are all quite poor, and what I've seen from the show I don't think they are off base. It could be that people love it or it could just be people are checking it out because of the hype. There's a lot of critics saying that nobody wants the show and nobody is watching it, but that's not what I'm seeing from download statistics.

I don't care much about Star Wars, I don't hate it but I was never a superfan either. I do happen to use torrent download statistics to determine what's popular and decide what I might want to watch though, since download stats are something the media companies are not inflating or faking, unlike reviews and media reports. I mean, I guess they could be, but it seems unlikely and would be pretty hard to pull off anyway.

I also saw another video talking about viewer numbers, which included several shows I've never heard of at the top and I didn't believe were actually that popular. Checking those on the tracker seemed to confirm that, none of them had the download numbers to back up the stats. They were also mixing movie and television numbers, which seemed odd.

So, I thought it might be fun to track the download stats for shows to see what the "real" watch statistics look like over time and build a history of what is really popular. These are stats from a single private tracker for a single popular encoding, anything with over 1,000 downloads in the last two weeks shows up in this list.
