<p>I recently had a chance to watch Gary Bernhardt's <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/git-workflow">git workflow</a> video and was blown away by a lot of the aliases he has set up (and by his workflow!). One of the coolest and most useful things he had setup was a log viewer that showed commits, their paths, the author, when it happened, comments and the branch they are attached to. Example:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012-git-log.png" alt="git oneliner with tree" /></p>

<p>You can see my <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow">git-flow</a> (an awesome project on it's own, blog post forthcoming) workflow in there on the left; see how the repo was branched and merged back in? As I said, crazy useful.</p>

<p>Setting this up was pretty simple too. Simply grab Gary's <a href="https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitconfig">.gitconfig</a> and <a href="https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles/blob/master/.githelpers">.githelpers</a> dot files and toss them in your home path. Or, better yet, just copy everything but the [user] data from the .gitconfig and toss it in yours. Then fire off a `git ra` and marvel are the glory!</p>
