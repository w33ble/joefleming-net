<p>Now that I'm <a href="/posts/my-move-to-mac">using a Mac</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/w33ble/screenshot-uploader">screenshot uploader</a> I wrote isn't all that helpful. Shame, I was really enjoying the quick and easy screenshot sharing. Fortunately, OSX has some built-in hotkeys for taking screenshots. What's more, you can change where they save. What's even <em>more</em>, you can add scripted actions to folders with Applescript. Mix in a little Dropbox, and BAM, I'm sharing screenshots with the greatest of ease!</p>

<p>The flow goes like this: Capture screenshot (selection, window, screen, whatever), it gets saved to my Dropbox Public folder, the link gets copied in to my clipboard, and I get a Growl notification when it's all ready to go. Here's how.</p>

<p>First, <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/01/26/change-the-screenshot-save-file-location-in-mac-os-x/">change the screenshot save location</a>:</p>

<pre><code>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Dropbox/Public
killall SystemUIServer</code></pre>

<p>Next, <a href="http://forums.dropbox.com/topic.php?id=4659">create an Applescript</a> file to copy the URL of new files:</p>

<pre><code>on adding folder items to this_folder after receiving added_items
	try
		set the item_count to the number of items in the added_items
		if the item_count is equal to 1 then
			set theFile to item 1 of added_items
			set theRawFilename to ("" & theFile)

			set tid to AppleScript's text item delimiters
			set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ":"
			set theFileName to (text item 6 of theRawFilename) as text
			set AppleScript's text item delimiters to tid

			set theWebSafeFileName to switchText from theFileName to "%20" instead of " "

			set theURL to "http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/8469532/" & theWebSafeFileName
			set the clipboard to theURL as text

			tell application "GrowlHelperApp"

				-- Make a list of all the notification types
				-- that this script will ever send:
				set the allNotificationsList to ¬
					{"Public URL"}

				set the enabledNotificationsList to allNotificationsList

				-- Register our script with growl.
				-- You can optionally (as here) set a default icon
				-- for this script's notifications.
				register as application ¬
					"CopyDropboxURL" all notifications allNotificationsList ¬
					default notifications enabledNotificationsList ¬
					icon of application "Dropbox"

				notify with name ¬
					"Public URL" title ¬
					"Dropbox Public Folder Updated" description ¬
					(theURL & " copied to clipboard.") application name "CopyDropboxURL"

			end tell
		end if
	end try
end adding folder items to

to switchText from t to r instead of s
	set d to text item delimiters
	set text item delimiters to s
	set t to t's text items
	set text item delimiters to r
	tell t to set t to item 1 & ({""} & rest)
	set text item delimiters to d
	t
end switchText</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Snap a screenshot (or drop a file in your Public folder, it all works the same), wait for the Growl notification, and paste away!</p>
