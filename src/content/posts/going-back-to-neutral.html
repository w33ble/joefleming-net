<p>It's been a while since I've had time to sit down and code anything. Since I've gone back to the world of full-time employment, I've had very little time to work on projects. It sucks, but it was expected. Worse, any time I do have free I always elect to just veg out and watch TV or something equally unproductive.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that I get burned out from work, but another, larger part of it is that I don't have a decent work space. My office is a mess and I usually find myself at my kitchen table, which I find is an awful place to work at. I recently read a Lifehacker post about <a href="http://updates.lifehacker.com/post/34850636076/stop-procrastinating-by-clearing-to-neutral">clearing to neutral</a> and it reflected a bunch of my feelings; I've always found it impossible to focus when my place is a mess.</p>

<p>So, I bought a new desk and I'm working on moving my workspace into another, empty room and starting from scratch. Hopefully this will be the reset I need to sit down and finally get shit done. We'll see soon.</p>
