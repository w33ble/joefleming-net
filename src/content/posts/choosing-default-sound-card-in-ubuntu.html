<p>On my machine I have a SoundBlaster Live card as well as an onboard VIA sound chip. Since Linux ignores the system BIOS, disabling the onboard sound doesn't do anything. Obviously I don't want to use the onboard sound card or I wouldn't have bothered putting the SBLive card in in the first place.

<p>Simple fix; we're going to change the default card to the SBLive card! This may not only apply to Ubuntu, but it's the only Linux distro I tried it in (since it's what I run). I think any distro using ALSA will work the same.</p>

<pre><code>$ asoundconf list

Names of available sound cards:
V8237
Live</code></pre>

<p>Your list may differ, but you should be able to find the card you want. In my case, it's the Live card. So....</p>

<pre><code>$ asoundconf set-default-card Live</code></pre>

<p>Note that I did not use <em>sudo</em> to list or change anything, it's a user setting. Now, restart any sound applications and you should be up and running. This should live through reboot as well.</p>
