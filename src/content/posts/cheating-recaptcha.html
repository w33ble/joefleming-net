<p>This isn't a post about bypassing <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha">reCAPTCHA</a>, but rather, some fun information about the service. I've mentioned this to a number of people, and I have yet to run in to someone else who already knew this. Hopefully you'll find it fun too. I don't recall how I know this, but apparently it's not exactly common knowledge.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Google bought reCAPTCHA</li>
	<li>Google is crowd-sourcing cleanup on the book scanning project</li>
	<li>reCAPTCHA is being used to do the crowd sourcing</li>
</ul>

<p>Case in point:</p>

<p>You've seen this type of captcha all over the place I'm sure, and it seems to be the Right Wayâ„¢ to do captchas. I know it used to work very well, and I trust since everyone still uses the service that it still works well. Here's the fun bit; <strong>you only have to correctly identify one of those words</strong>. Put another way, you can enter anything you want for one word as long as you get the other, proper word right.</p>

<p>So how do you tell which one you have to solve correctly? It's a little hit or miss, but usually it's the harder one to read, the one that's all wavy and is usually not a word but instead just a random string of letters. In this case, I only need to get <em>andignsu</em> right, the other word is used to either aid or confirm Google's book scanning OCR algorithm. Typing in, say <em>andignsu butterflies</em> would count as a success.</p>

<p>And there you go, now you know how to hack reCAPTCHA and successfully make it through without properly solving it. Great nerdy fun!</p>
