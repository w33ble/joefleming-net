title: "Configuring Access in MediaWiki"

<p>I've set up <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org" rel="ext">Mediawiki</a> in a few times now, both at work and for personal use. Each time I do it, I end up having to learn how to set up access restriction again. That is, creating custom namespaces and restricting access to those namespaces to people that belong in specific groups.</p>

<p>The reason I do this is to keep of people out of articles that only privileged users should really be seeing. Articles about server configurations, software development, new ideas for sites, etc. Making a hidden namespace and allowing only specific groups to access it is the simplest way to go about this task.</p>

<p>Doing this is pretty straightforward.  I won't get in to all the specifics though; instead I'll post links to the exact information you'll need to pull it off.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/LocalSettings.php#User_rights" rel="ext">User Rights</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/LocalSettings.php#Custom_namespaces" rel="ext"> Custom Namespaces</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:%24wgGroupPermissions" rel="ext"> Group Permissions</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Preventing_Access#Setting_permissions_for_a_Group_on_a_whole_new_Namespace" rel="ext"> Setting permissions for a Group on a whole new Namespace</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There you have it, nice and easy! Now I just need to fix/reinstall our personal wiki...</p>
