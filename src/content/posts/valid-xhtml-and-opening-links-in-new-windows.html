title: "Valid XHTML and Opening Links in New Windows"

<p>Well, as you can plainly see (assuming you've been here before), the site has gotten a facelift. Now that <a href="http://aaronstaves.com/">Aaron</a> has his blog up and his looking really nice, I felt compelled to try and jazz up mine a little too. It's not done, but it's nicer than it was. I'll probably add a touch of color to the theme, but it'll work for now. BTW, it's based off the <a href="http://weyland.be/wrdprss/index.php/2006/01/05/wordpress-theme-milc3-35/">Milc 3.5</a> theme. The code isn't super pretty, but it was a good start.</p>

<p>While I was working with the design, I realized that I needed to send over my old bit of code that opened links in new windows. As anyone trying to make valid XHML pages can tell you, the <em>target</em> attribute is no longer valid, so if you want pages to open in a new window and you still want your design to validate properly, you have to do a little scripting. I actually found this script a couple years ago to make MediaWiki links open in new windows and it's served me quite well ever since.</p>

<pre><code class="hljs javascript">
function makeExternal() {
        //make sure the function works
        if (! document.getElementsByTagName) { return; }
        var myRegExp = new RegExp("ext","i");
        var anchors = document.getElementsByTagName("a");
        for (var i=0; i < anchors.length; i++) {
                var anchor = anchors[i];
                if (anchor.getAttribute("alt") && anchor.getAttribute("alt").match(myRegExp) ) { anchor.className+=" external"; anchor.target="_blank"; }
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You run the function at page load and selected links will now open in a new window. To make a link work this way, you add <em>rel="ext"</em> to the anchor tag, which is still valid because <em>rel</em> is a valid attribute. What's nice is this also sets up a relation between your page and the link; ext being short for external. The script parses all anchors for that <em>rel</em> attribute and if it finds <em>ext</em> in value, it appends the class 'external' and sets the target attribute of the link to '_blank'. It's a little hacky, but it works like a charm and any browser with a DOM that supports getElementsByTagName.</p>

<p>Note that you don't have to append any class name if you don't want to. I like that I can make the links indicate that they will be opening in a new window by using a little icon as you can see on this site. I like the icon MediaWiki uses a lot, but the way it uses (indicating that it's an external link) doesn't make as much sense as using it to show that a new window will open. That's my take anyway.</p>

<p>This isn't the only way to achieve this result, and Google will provide you with a million other ways, but this is what works for me. Just thought I'd share.</p>

<p>UPDATE: This code is no longer used on this site.</p>
