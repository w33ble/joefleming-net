title: "Wordpress Users, Check Your Registered User List"

<p>I recently got an email saying that I had a new user register here. Out of curiosity, I checked who it was, but neither the name nor the email was familiar to me. The username was alina77vere9uk and the email alina77vere@gmail.com, which to me looked like the kind of email address that you'd see on a SPAM email, so I tossed it into Google to see what I'd find.</p>

<p>Sure enough, I'm not the only person who's had this user register. As pointed out <a href="http://cubelodyte.com/2008/03/21/another-slice-of-spam/">over at the Cubelodyte's lair</a>, this is mot likely a bot that is registering on Wordpess blogs all over the Internet, and while it's not posting any comments, it's highly likely that it'll release some kind of SPAM payload at a later date. So, if you see this user register on your Wordpress blog, go ahead and delete them before then SPAM hits the fan.</p>

<p>User 'joker' says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I really don't understand why people delete the account. I came up with what I think is a better solutionthen just deleting the account.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>I changed the password for that account.</li>
    <li>I made it so the user doesn't even have read rights. Thanks Role Manager.</li>
    <li>I changed almost everything about the user to indicate it is a spam account.</li>
    <li>I disabled the forgot password feature. Thanks WP-IDS.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>That's actually a really good idea; keep the account active but disable it. That way the user can't be re-created. I guess I was a little hasty about it. Oh well.</p>
